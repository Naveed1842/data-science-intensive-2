Data wrangling work for Shark tank project

The original data which I found related to Shark tank products had the following data – 
1)	Season , episode
2)	Company name
3)	Deal – yes/No
4)	Industry
5)	Gender of Entreprenuer
6)	Ask Equity
7)	Ask Valuation
8)	Deal Equity
9)	Deal Valuation
10)	Royalty deal - yes/no and how much?
11)	Investor
12)	$ per share among investors

I was able to add more parameters to this data set –
1)	Get the website of the company/product by using BING search API and some basic python code
2)	Get the Facebook page of the company/product using BING search API and using that to call Facebook API to get the popularity of the product/service such as – likes, reviews, rating, business_category, date_founded
3)	I came across a site called shartankblog.com that has information about each and every shark tank product/service. I was able to get the web page by using BING API search - product+shartankblog. This website has really useful info about the products which I can utilize - like, I was thinking I can get the price of each item, number of units already sold, profit margin etc. I was also thinking, if it would be a good idea to some basic sentiment analysis on the webpage
4)	I was able to use ALEXA web api to get the popularity of a website by getting information such as - #Of inward links, rank, rank by country, # page views, categories etc

Services used to add more parameters – 
1)	BING Search API
2)	Facebook API
3)	ALEXA Web API
