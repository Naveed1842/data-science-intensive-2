The idea of donorschoose.org is pretty simple. It lets public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials 
and experiences for their students and donors could donate to projects based on their interest.

1) What kind of projects would be more successfull and based on what factors ?<br>
2) What kind of donors would be more generous ?<br>
3) What kind of donors would interest what kind of projects ?<br>
