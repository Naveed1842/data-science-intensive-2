Project Ideas I am interested in - 

1) Ebay Bidding -
Predicting the final selling price of an item that has been auctioned. 
The dataset contains historical auction data from eBay. I would like to utilize machine learning algortihms to predict the sales results
of items which were auctioned

Dataset - http://cims.nyu.edu/~munoz/data/


2) Movielens data -
Building a Recommendation system to determine which movies are liked by what kind of audience.
The dataset contains Ratings info, User info and Movie info

Dataset: http://www.grouplens.org/system/files/ml-1m.zip


3) Predicting a Shark's investment 
I could utilize this data set to analyze various patterns and then be able to build a machine learning model that predicts - 
What kind of offer would result in a Shark ready to invest on it ?
I could also combine this data set with some other interesting data sets pertaining to the investments made by the Sharks outside of
Shark Tank.
